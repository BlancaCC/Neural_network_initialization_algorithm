We have tried to apply agile principles to the whole development process, from
the more mathematical to the minimally viable product that was the developed
code and this paper \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-2104-12545}.

Since in 1988, Hornik, Stinchombe and White established
that Multilayer Feedforward Networks are Universal Approximators \cite{HORNIK1989359} this tools have revolutionized artificial intelligence. 

Backpropagation \cite{backpropagation-Hinton} and its 
variants are relevant methods to update neural 
network's weights. However one of its weak spots comes from being iterative 
algorithms, since an initial point is needed (ie a initial setting of the weights of the neuronal network). In order to determine this point 
there are some heuristics such as random initialization
closed to null values or features transference. 

In order to determine that initial state we propose a initialization method based on the training data. 

To introduce our method we are going to use One Layer
Feedforward Networks \cite{HORNIK1989359} , from now on we will refer to them as Neural Networks. 
Moreove, we show how this algorithm improve random initiallization.
