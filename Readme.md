# Initialization algorithm for neural networks  

This is a draft for an algorithm to determine the weight of a one layer neural network. 

- The draft paper can be found at `Article` dir.

-  The algorithm can be found at `src` and the notebook `code_example` contains a usage example of the package.
  
-  At `Experiment/processing_house_price.ipynb`  the data processing and experiment execution are found. Its generate a `csv` file with the results. 

- Tests can be executed by `make test`
